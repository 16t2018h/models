<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Einstein's Riddle is a multi-dimensional constraint satisfaction problem which is captivating, challenging and solvable by humans with or without computing machinery. It serves as an entertaining platform for the study of constraint satisfaction problems and tools. This paper presents a solver of Einstein's Riddle modeled in xtUML. Constraints are modeled as links between instances of UML classes.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Albert Einstein is credited with a riddle which goes something like:</p>
<p>There are 5 houses in five different colors.<br />
In each house lives a person with a different nationality.<br />
These five owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke<br />
a certain brand of cigar and keep a certain pet.<br />
No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar<br />
or drink the same beverage.</p>
<p>...followed by a question:</p>
<p>Who owns the fish?</p>
<p>'Hints' follow that amount to constraints on the system. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The Brit lives in the red house.</li>
<li>The Swede keeps dogs as pets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hints constrain the problem such that there is exactly one solution. The riddle offers information that can be captured in a relational class model rich in associations and instances. Such a model has been built and its capabilities, advantages and disadvantages are explored.</p>
<p>This paper reports the experience of modeling Einstein's Riddle in Executable UML (xtUML). The riddle has been solved in other languages specific to Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). The general purpose UML model is compared and contrasted with SMT solvers (such as one implemented in Z3). The applicability of SMT tree walker/solvers to executable UML metamodels is explored. Observations are made and questions for future work are raised.</p>
